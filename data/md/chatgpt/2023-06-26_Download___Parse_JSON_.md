It seems like you're in the middle of creating an asynchronous function in Swift to download and parse a JSON. As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, Swift 5.5 introduced the new concurrency model with async/await, and the Codable protocol can be used for data parsing. Here's a basic example using URLSession:

```swift
import Foundation

public func downloadAndParseJson<T>(from url: URL) async throws -> T where T: Decodable {
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    let decodedData = try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: data)
    return decodedData
}
```

In this example, you would provide a URL rather than a key to download data from. It's important to note that this function doesn't take into account error handling for network requests or decoding the JSON. If an error occurs, this function will throw it to the calling context, and it should be handled there. 

The function also assumes that the data received from the URL can be directly decoded into the specified generic type `T`. You might need to adjust this depending on the structure of your JSON and your model types. If you want to call this function with a URL and a type that conforms to `Decodable`, you could do something like this:

```swift
do {
    let url = URL(string: "https://myapi.com/data")!
    let data: MyType = try await downloadAndParseJson(from: url)
    print(data)
} catch {
    print("An error occurred: \(error)")
}
```

Just replace `MyType` with whatever type you're expecting the JSON data to decode into. The type must conform to `Decodable`.
