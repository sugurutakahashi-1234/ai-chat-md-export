In GitHub, a `pull_request_review_comment` refers to a comment left on the code changes in a pull request during the review process. These comments can provide feedback, ask questions, or suggest improvements regarding specific lines of code in the pull request. Here's how it's typically used:

1. **Review Process**: When a reviewer looks at a pull request, they can select specific lines of code and leave a `pull_request_review_comment` to point out improvements or concerns.
2. **Inline Comments**: These comments appear directly next to the relevant code, making it easier for the author to address the feedback in context.
3. **Collaborative Feedback**: They facilitate back-and-forth communication between the reviewer and the author to ensure the code meets the necessary quality and functional standards before merging.
