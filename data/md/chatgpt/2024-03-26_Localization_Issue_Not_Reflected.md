Title: Localization Updates Not Reflected in Specific Region

Body:

Hello,

I've encountered an issue where localization updates are not being reflected in the intended region.

To reproduce this issue, I followed these steps:
1. In Xcode, navigate to Edit Scheme &gt; Selected Production &gt; Options &gt; App Language.
2. Set the language to English.
3. Built the app using the simulator.

Despite these settings, the localization changes do not appear to be applied as expected. This issue was observed under the following environment:
- Xcode version: 15.3
- Device: iPhone 15 Pro (simulator)
- iOS version: 17.4
- macOS version: 14.4.1

I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue, as it is crucial for our application's user experience across different regions.

Thank you for your time and assistance.
