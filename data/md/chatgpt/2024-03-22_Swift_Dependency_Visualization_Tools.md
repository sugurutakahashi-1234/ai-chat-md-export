Yes, there are tools available to help visualize Swift Package Manager dependencies:

1. **SPMDependencyGraph**: This is a command-line tool designed to help visualize your Swift Package Manager dependencies. It can take one or more paths to load `Package.swift` files, including directories of projects containing a `Package.swift` file or directories of projects containing `Package.swift` files, making it versatile for different project setups. For more detailed information and usage instructions, you can visit its GitHub repository【5†source】.

2. **DependencyGraph**: Available on the Swift Package Registry, this tool focuses on visualizing local dependencies, i.e., Swift packages stored locally within a project. While it includes remote dependencies in its visualization, it does not clone those dependencies to determine their dependency graph, which could be a limitation depending on your needs. More about its capabilities and technical details can be found on its registry page【6†source】.

3. **DependencyGraph by Simon B. Støvring**: This command-line tool is designed to visualize the dependencies of packages. It's actively developed, with a significant number of commits and contributions. The tool is available through the Swift Package Index, where you can find more information about its compatibility, usage, and development status【7†source】.

These tools provide different levels of functionality and focus, from visualizing local project dependencies to more comprehensive analyses including remote dependencies. Depending on your specific needs and the complexity of your project, one of these tools might suit you well.
