**Proposed Modifications**

I have verified that the following steps resolve the issue:

**Step 1: Add InfoPlist.strings**
- Navigate to `Production > Production > Resources`.
- Choose "Add New File…" and create `InfoPlist.strings`.

**Step 2: Extract String Catalogs**
- Build the Production target to ensure `InfoPlist.strings` generates the `CFBundleName` and `CFBundleDisplayName` keys.

**Step 3: Add English Localization**

**Step 4: Change Language Setting**
- From "Edit Scheme", change the language setting to English, then build again.

I corrected "Produnction" to "Production" and changed "xcstrings" to "strings", assuming you meant ".strings" files typically used for localization in Xcode projects. If "xcstrings" was intentional for a specific use case, you might want to revert that change. Also, I've formatted the steps for better readability and precision.

Certainly! Adding a polite note at the end to acknowledge the possibility of repeating official information is thoughtful. Here's how you could conclude your comment:

By the way, if this is already mentioned officially somewhere, my bad! Just hoping it might help someone else stuck on the same issue.
