翻訳してほしい

Thanks for introducing this feature! Would it be possible to make a new official release containing this change? Right now we're blocked from installing mockolo from homebrew, because that version doesn't support typed throws yet.

この機能を導入していただきありがとうございます！この変更を含む新しい公式リリースを作成していただくことは可能でしょうか？現在、HomebrewからMockoloをインストールすることができず、というのも、そのバージョンがまだ型付きthrowsをサポートしていないためです。
