The error you're encountering is due to a situation where the remote repository (`main` branch) has changes that you do not have locally, so Git is rejecting your push. The best approach is to fetch and integrate these remote changes before pushing your local changes.

You can resolve this with the following steps:

1. **Pull the remote changes and rebase your local changes:**

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```

   This will pull the latest changes from the remote `main` branch and apply your local changes on top of them.

2. **Push your changes:**

   Once the rebase is successful, you can push the changes:

   ```bash
   git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main
   ```

This should resolve the issue. If you run into any merge conflicts during the rebase, Git will prompt you to resolve them before continuing.

Alternatively, if you don't need to keep the remote changes, you can force-push your changes (but be cautious, as this will overwrite any remote changes):

```bash
git push --force origin HEAD:refs/heads/main
```

Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!
