The error you're encountering, `NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-10814`, typically relates to issues with accessing or sharing a file. Here are a few steps you can take to diagnose and resolve the issue:

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Check File Path and Permissions:**
   - Ensure the file exists at the specified path.
   - Verify that your app has permission to access the file. This may involve checking file permissions and the app's entitlements.

2. **File URL Validity:**
   - Confirm that the file URL is correctly formatted. Sometimes issues can arise from incorrectly formatted file URLs.

3. **Temporary Directory Access:**
   - Files in the `tmp` directory can sometimes be transient or have restricted access. Consider moving the file to a more persistent location if needed.

4. **Entitlements and Capabilities:**
   - Ensure your app has the necessary entitlements and capabilities enabled, such as file sharing, if relevant.

5. **Check for File Locking:**
   - Ensure that no other process or part of your app is locking the file, which could prevent it from being accessed or shared.

### Sample Code to Check File Existence and Permissions

You can use the following Swift code to check if the file exists and whether your app has read access to it:

```swift
import Foundation

let fileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/DE41726A-EC1E-447C-8A80-582666CAC2B6/tmp/2024-05-16T20:31:21+09:00.m4a")

let fileManager = FileManager.default

// Check if file exists
if fileManager.fileExists(atPath: fileURL.path) {
    print("File exists at path: \(fileURL.path)")
    
    // Check read access
    if fileManager.isReadableFile(atPath: fileURL.path) {
        print("File is readable")
    } else {
        print("File is not readable")
    }
} else {
    print("File does not exist at path: \(fileURL.path)")
}
```

### Handling File Sharing in Swift

When attempting to share a file, ensure you are using the appropriate methods and handling any errors that may arise:

```swift
import UIKit

func shareFile(fileURL: URL, from viewController: UIViewController) {
    let activityViewController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [fileURL], applicationActivities: nil)
    
    activityViewController.completionWithItemsHandler = { activity, success, items, error in
        if let error = error {
            print("Failed to share file: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } else {
            print("File shared successfully")
        }
    }
    
    viewController.present(activityViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

### Debugging Tips

- **Logs and Breakpoints:** Add logs and set breakpoints to determine where the failure occurs.
- **Permissions:** Verify your appâ€™s entitlements and Info.plist for permissions related to file access and sharing.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about the context in which this error occurs, such as the specific operation you are performing when the error is raised.
