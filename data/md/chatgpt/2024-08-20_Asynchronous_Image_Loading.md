Synchronous URL loading of https://picsum.photos/586/592 should not occur on this application's main thread as it may lead to UI unresponsiveness. Please switch to an asynchronous networking API such as URLSession.
extension UIImage {
    @MainActor
    public convenience init(imageUrl: URL) throws {
        do {
            let data = try Data(contentsOf: imageUrl)
            guard UIImage(data: data) != nil else {
                throw NSError(domain: "UIImageErrorDomain", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Unable to create UIImage from data."])
            }
            self.init(data: data)!
        } catch {
            throw error
        }
    }
}

To avoid blocking the main thread when loading images from a URL, you should use `URLSession` to fetch the image data asynchronously. Here's an updated version of your code that leverages `URLSession` and async/await, which is available in Swift 5.5 and later.

```swift
import UIKit

extension UIImage {
    @MainActor
    public convenience init(imageUrl: URL) async throws {
        do {
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: imageUrl)
            guard let image = UIImage(data: data) else {
                throw NSError(domain: "UIImageErrorDomain", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Unable to create UIImage from data."])
            }
            self.init(data: data)!
        } catch {
            throw error
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage Example

Here's how you might use this async initializer:

```swift
func loadImage(from url: URL) {
    Task {
        do {
            let image = try await UIImage(imageUrl: url)
            // Update your UI with the image
        } catch {
            // Handle the error
            print("Failed to load image: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Changes
- **Asynchronous URL Loading**: The `URLSession.shared.data(from:)` function is used to fetch data from the URL asynchronously.
- **@MainActor Annotation**: The initializer is still marked with `@MainActor` to ensure UI updates occur on the main thread.
- **Error Handling**: Errors during the download or image creation are thrown and can be handled in the calling code.

This approach ensures that the image loading process does not block the main thread, preventing UI unresponsiveness.
