The error you're encountering suggests an issue with the Flutter command or the environment setup during the Gradle task execution. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

---

### **1. Check FVM Configuration**
Since you're using `fvm`, ensure that the Flutter version (`3.27.1`) is correctly set for the project:

- **Run:**
  ```bash
  fvm flutter doctor
  ```
  Verify that the Flutter version is correctly installed and active for the project.

- **Check Project FVM Settings:**
  Confirm that the `fvm` configuration is set up in the project directory:
  ```bash
  cat .fvm/fvm_config.json
  ```
  Ensure the Flutter version matches the installed one.

---

### **2. Verify Flutter Path in Gradle**
The error indicates a problem starting the Flutter command. Verify that the Flutter binary path is correctly resolved in your Gradle configuration:

- Open `android/local.properties` and confirm the path to the Flutter SDK:
  ```properties
  flutter.sdk=/Users/sugurutakahashi/fvm/versions/3.27.1
  ```

- If `flutter.sdk` is missing or incorrect, update it to point to the correct `fvm` path.

---

### **3. Check Permissions**
Ensure that the `flutter` binary in the specified `fvm` path has execute permissions:

- **Run:**
  ```bash
  chmod +x /Users/sugurutakahashi/fvm/versions/3.27.1/bin/flutter
  ```

---

### **4. Clean and Rebuild**
Sometimes build artifacts can cause issues. Clean the project and rebuild:

- **Run:**
  ```bash
  fvm flutter clean
  fvm flutter pub get
  ```

- Then rebuild the project:
  ```bash
  fvm flutter build apk
  ```

---

### **5. Verify Java and Android SDK Setup**
Ensure the Java and Android SDK environments are correctly configured:

- **Check Java:**
  ```bash
  java -version
  ```
  Use JDK 11 or 17, as Flutter may not support newer versions.

- **Check Android SDK:**
  Ensure the `ANDROID_HOME` and `PATH` variables are set correctly.

---

### **6. Debug Gradle**
Run Gradle with additional debugging options to get more information about the issue:

- **Run:**
  ```bash
  ./gradlew assembleDebug --stacktrace
  ./gradlew assembleDebug --info
  ```

Review the logs for specific errors.

---

### **7. Update Dependencies**
Ensure that the Flutter project and its dependencies are compatible with the Flutter version:

- **Run:**
  ```bash
  fvm flutter pub upgrade
  ```

---

### **8. Reinstall FVM**
If the issue persists, reinstall FVM and ensure everything is properly set up:

- Uninstall FVM:
  ```bash
  dart pub global deactivate fvm
  ```

- Reinstall FVM:
  ```bash
  dart pub global activate fvm
  ```

- Reinstall the Flutter version:
  ```bash
  fvm install 3.27.1
  ```

- Set the version for your project:
  ```bash
  fvm use 3.27.1
  ```

---

### **9. Try Without FVM**
As a temporary workaround, you can bypass FVM to see if the issue is specific to it:

- **Run:**
  ```bash
  flutter doctor
  flutter build apk
  ```

---

If these steps don't resolve the issue, share the detailed output of the `--stacktrace` or `--info` logs for further troubleshooting.
