In Dart, when a method is primarily used to change a property, it's often more idiomatic to use a **setter** instead of a method. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Example

Suppose you have a class with a method like this:

```dart
class MyClass {
  String _name = '';

  void setName(String name) {
    _name = name;
  }

  String get name => _name;
}
```

Instead of using the `setName` method, you can convert it into a setter:

### Using a Setter

```dart
class MyClass {
  String _name = '';

  // Setter for the name property
  set name(String name) {
    _name = name;
  }

  // Getter for the name property
  String get name => _name;
}
```

### Usage

```dart
void main() {
  MyClass myClass = MyClass();

  // Using the setter
  myClass.name = 'John Doe';

  // Accessing the property
  print(myClass.name); // Output: John Doe
}
```

### Benefits of Using Setters
- **Cleaner Syntax:** Instead of calling a method like `setName('value')`, you can simply assign a value with `object.name = 'value';`.
- **Encapsulation:** You can still enforce validation or additional logic inside the setter while keeping the interface clean and intuitive.

### Notes
- Always ensure the setter logic is clear and predictable.
- Use setters only when the primary purpose of the method is to change a property. If the method does more complex operations, keeping it as a method might be more appropriate.
