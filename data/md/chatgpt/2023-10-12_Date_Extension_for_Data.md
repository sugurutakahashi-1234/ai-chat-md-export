The code you've provided is a `String` extension initializer that takes a `Data` instance, typically representing a device token, and converts it to a hexadecimal string. If you want to create a similar extension for the `Date` type, it's important to consider what kind of data or value you want to initialize a `Date` object with.

The `Date` type usually represents a specific point in time, so initializing it with a device token (which is just a unique identifier for app installations and not related to a date or time) wouldn't be semantically correct or meaningful. 

However, if you have a specific case in mind, such as initializing a `Date` object with a timestamp contained within a `Data` object or another scenario, you'd need to decode that data into a format that makes sense for date and time. Here's a general example of how you might extend `Date` to be initialized with a `Data` object assuming the data contains a time interval (timestamp):

```swift
import Foundation

public extension Date {
    init?(deviceTokenData: Data) {
        // Assume that the deviceTokenData is a timestamp for the example.
        // The Data must be converted to a TimeInterval (time in seconds since reference date).
        
        guard deviceTokenData.count == MemoryLayout<TimeInterval>.size else { 
            // The data's size isn't correct for a TimeInterval; initialization should fail.
            return nil
        }
        
        var interval: TimeInterval = 0
        let _ = withUnsafeMutableBytes(of: &interval) { deviceTokenData.copyBytes(to: $0) }
        
        // Initialize the Date with the time interval since the reference date.
        self.init(timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate: interval)
    }
}
```

In this script, it's assumed that the `Data` instance you're receiving is a binary representation of a `TimeInterval` value (essentially, a `Double`). The script attempts to safely unpack a `TimeInterval` from the provided `Data` and then initialize a `Date` instance with it. Please ensure the `Data` you're passing into this initializer is formatted as expected, or modify the data extraction logic to suit the actual format of your data.

Remember, this is a contrived example, because typically device tokens don't contain temporal information. If your `Data` object contains date information in another format (like a formatted date string), you'd need a different approach to parse that data and initialize the `Date` instance.
