The `env.package_path` and `env.documentation_target` variables should be correctly reflected and utilized in your GitHub Actions workflow. The `env` section at the top defines these environment variables, which are then referenced in the `run` command within the `build` job. Here's a slightly modified version of your script with added comments for clarity:

```yaml
name: Swift-DocC Host

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  package_path: SmallTalkPackage
  documentation_target: DomainLayer

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-14
    env:
      DEVELOPER_DIR: /Applications/Xcode_15.4.app/Contents/Developer
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: build docc
        run: |
          swift package --package-path ${{ env.package_path }} --allow-writing-to-directory ./docs \
          generate-documentation --target ${{ env.documentation_target }} \
          --disable-indexing \
          --transform-for-static-hosting \
          --output-path ./docs
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: docs

  deploy:
    needs: build
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

In this script:

1. The `env` section at the top defines `package_path` and `documentation_target`.
2. These environment variables are referenced in the `build docc` step using the `${{ env.variable_name }}` syntax.

This approach should ensure that `env.package_path` and `env.documentation_target` are correctly reflected in your `swift package` command, allowing for the proper generation and deployment of your documentation. If you encounter any issues, check the workflow logs for any errors related to these variables to ensure they are being passed correctly.
