does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.
2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
A. Limited License. Subject to the terms of this License and your compliance with
Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, you are granted a limited, non-transferable,
non-exclusive license to use the Apple Design Resources solely for creating mockups of user interfaces designed for use in software products that run only on Apple’s

You may use the Apple Design Resources only for the purposes described in this
License or as otherwise expressly permitted by Apple in writing.
B. Other Use Restrictions. The grants set forth in this License do not permit you to,

C. Template Content. The Apple Design Resources licensed hereunder contain
content such as interfaces, graphics, artwork, images, and similar content
(individually and collectively, the “Template Content”), for use in creating your MockUps in accordance with this License. To the extent that you provide Mock-Ups you
create using the Template Content to any other party, you agree to ensure that each
such recipient is aware of the restrictions set forth in this License including, without
limitation, the restriction on extraction of Template Content and the requirement that
the Template Content be used only for Mock-Ups of user interfaces for software
products that would run only on Apple’s macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and/or
visionOS operating system software. The Template Content may not otherwise be
used, extracted, copied, modified, distributed, or repackaged as content, clip art,
stock animation, or similar assets, or in any other manner.

enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this License), decompile,
reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, create derivative works of the Apple Design Resources or any part thereof
(except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable
law).
E. Compliance with Laws. You agree to use the Apple Design Resources in 
compliance with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in
which you reside or in which you download or use the Apple Design Resources.

License may not be assigned by you, nor may the rights granted hereunder be
transferred by you, in whole or in part, through acquisition, merger or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of a duly authorized representative of Apple. Any
attempted assignment in contravention of this section shall be void.
4. Termination. This License shall commence upon your installation or use of the
Apple Design Resources. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically
or cease to be effective without notice from Apple (a) if you fail to comply with any
term(s) of this License or (b) if Apple releases a version of the Apple Design
Resources which is incompatible with this version of the Apple Design Resources.
Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Apple Design
Resources and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Apple Design Resources.
Section 2B, 2D, and 5 through 10 of this License shall survive any termination.

LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS “APPLE” FOR THE PURPOSES OF
SECTIONS 5 AND 6) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS
WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLE DESIGN RESOURCES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED
OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.
C. APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR
ENJOYMENT OF THE APPLE DESIGN RESOURCES, THAT THE FUNCTIONS
CONTAINED IN THE APPLE DESIGN RESOURCES WILL MEET YOUR
REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE APPLE DESIGN RESOURCES
WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT THE APPLE DESIGN

APPLE DESIGN RESOURCES MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY AND USABILITY OF
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY SERVICES, AS WELL
AS APPLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.
D. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE APPLE DESIGN RESOURCES IS NOT
INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE IN SITUATIONS OR ENVIRONMENTS WHERE
THE FAILURE OR TIME DELAYS OF, OR ERRORS OR INACCURACIES IN THE
CONTENT, DATA OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY, THE APPLE DESIGN
RESOURCES COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL
OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE
OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR
WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
E. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN
APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD
THE APPLE DESIGN RESOURCES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE
COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA
OR INFORMATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE APPLE DESIGN RESOURCES OR ANY THIRD PARTY
SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS, OR SERVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPLE
DESIGN RESOURCES, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL
INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION
MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple’s total liability to you for all
damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving
personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations
will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
7. Export Control. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Apple Design
Resources except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the
jurisdiction(s) in which the Apple Design Resources was obtained. In particular, but
without limitation, the Apple Design Resources may not be exported or re-exported
(a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury
Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of
Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List or any other restricted party lists. By
using the Apple Design Resources, you represent and warrant that you are not
located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not use
the Apple Design Resources for any purposes prohibited by United States law,
including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of
missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.

are “Commercial Items”, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of
“Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software
Documentation”, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202,
as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through
227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial

(a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other
end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved
under the copyright laws of the United States.
9. Controlling Law and Severability. This License will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of law
principles. This License shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly
excluded. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or
portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of this License shall continue in
full force and effect.
10. Complete Agreement; Governing Language. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between you and Apple relating to the use of the Apple Design Resources
