The error message indicates that a **fast-forward merge** isn't possible. This usually happens when your local branch and the remote `develop` branch have diverged‚Äîmeaning there are new commits on both branches.

Here's how to resolve the issue:

### 1. **Check for Local Changes**
First, ensure you don‚Äôt have uncommitted changes:
```bash
git status
```
- If you have uncommitted changes, commit or stash them:
  ```bash
  git stash
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Save changes before pull"
  ```

### 2. **Pull with Rebase**
To synchronize your branch with the remote without creating a merge commit:
```bash
git pull --rebase origin develop
```

This will:
- Fetch the remote `develop` branch.
- Replay your local commits on top of the remote commits.

If there are conflicts, Git will pause, allowing you to resolve them manually. Once resolved:
```bash
git rebase --continue
```

### 3. **Merge Changes (If Rebase Fails)**
If rebase fails or is not ideal for your workflow, you can perform a merge instead:
```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop
```

If there are merge conflicts:
- Resolve them manually.
- Then, complete the merge:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit
  ```

### 4. **Force Pull (Last Resort)**
If you‚Äôre confident you want to discard local changes and sync exactly with the remote branch, use:
```bash
git reset --hard origin/develop
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This will erase any local changes not pushed to the remote!

Let me know if you encounter conflicts or need guidance on specific steps!
