### Request: Support for OpenAPI v3.1.0

\*\*Description:\*\*

First, I want to express my gratitude for the excellent work on this action! It has been incredibly useful in our workflows. 

I am writing to request the addition of support for OpenAPI v3.1.0 in the `swagger-ui-action`. The latest version of OpenAPI includes several enhancements and changes that would benefit from being directly supported by this action.

\*\*Benefits of Supporting OpenAPI v3.1.0:\*\*

1. \*\*Enhanced JSON Schema Compatibility:\*\* OpenAPI v3.1.0 aligns with the latest JSON Schema, which allows for more robust and expressive API definitions.
2. \*\*Improved Security Schemes:\*\* The new version includes updates and more flexible configurations for security schemes.
3. \*\*Extended Data Types:\*\* Better support for newer data types and more precise API documentation.

\*\*Proposed Changes:\*\*

1. Update the underlying Swagger UI version to one that fully supports OpenAPI v3.1.0.
2. Adjust any schema validation and transformation logic to accommodate OpenAPI v3.1.0 features.
3. Provide examples or documentation on how to use OpenAPI v3.1.0 with this action.

\*\*Impact:\*\*

These updates will ensure that users leveraging the latest OpenAPI specifications can fully utilize the capabilities of the `swagger-ui-action`, thus maintaining its relevance and utility.

Thank you for considering this request. Looking forward to the continued improvement of this great tool!

Best regards,
\[Your Name\]
