This message indicates that your SSH key is working correctly for GitHub authentication. When you run `ssh -T git@github.com`, GitHub verifies your SSH key, and the "Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated" message confirms that youâ€™ve authenticated successfully. However, GitHub does not provide direct shell access to users, so the message also indicates that you cannot use SSH to open a shell session on GitHub's servers.

You're all set to perform Git operations with your GitHub repositories using SSH! If you need help with any specific Git commands, feel free to ask.

GitHub restricts SSH access to prevent users from opening shell sessions on their servers for security and resource management reasons. Unlike traditional servers, GitHub's SSH access is designed specifically to facilitate secure Git operations (like cloning, pushing, and pulling repositories) without providing users with full shell access. Allowing full shell access would open up security vulnerabilities, expose sensitive data, and potentially lead to performance issues on their infrastructure.

When you connect via SSH, GitHub uses this connection purely to verify your identity, ensuring that you're authorized to interact with
