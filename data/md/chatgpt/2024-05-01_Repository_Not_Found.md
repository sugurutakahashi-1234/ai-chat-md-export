The error message you received indicates that Git cannot find the repository you're trying to push to. This could be due to several reasons:

1. \*\*Incorrect URL\*\*: Check that the URL you used to add the remote repository is correct. The format should be `https://github.com/username/repository.git`. Ensure there are no typos in the username or repository name.

2. \*\*Repository Does Not Exist\*\*: Make sure that the repository actually exists on GitHub. You might need to create a new repository if you haven't already done so.

3. \*\*Access Rights\*\*: Verify that you have the correct access rights to the repository. If it's a private repository or you're trying to push to a repository owned by someone else, ensure that you have been granted the appropriate permissions.

4. \*\*Network Issues\*\*: There could be a network issue preventing you from accessing GitHub. Check your internet connection and try again.

To resolve the issue, you can try the following steps:

- Double-check the remote URL with `git remote -v` and correct it if necessary using `git remote set-url origin \[correct-url\]`.
- Ensure the repository exists on GitHub and you have permission to access it.
- If you haven't added a remote repository yet, you can add it using `git remote add origin \[repository-url\]`.

If the repository should exist and you believe you are using the correct URL and have proper access, it might be a temporary issue with GitHub. In that case, try the operation again after some time.
