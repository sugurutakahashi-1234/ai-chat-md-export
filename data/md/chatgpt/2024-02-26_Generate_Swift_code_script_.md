I need you to create a swift macro that supports swift 5.9 or later that generates the following from a struct called Setting.

Setting is replaceable.

````
struct Setting {}
```

Generate the following.

```
// MARK: Wireframe
import Foundation
import DomainLayer

// TODO: add SettingWireframe to AppRootRouter
public protocol SettingWireframe {}

// MARK: PresenterDependency
import Foundation
import DomainLayer

public protocol SettingPresenterDependency {}
```

In this case, "Setting" is used as the argument.

To create a Swift macro that generates the specified code for any given struct name (like `Setting` in your example), you would ideally use a code generation tool or script, as Swift itself does not support macros in the same way that languages like C or Rust do. However, you can achieve a similar outcome using Swift's code generation tools, such as Sourcery, or by writing a simple script in another language that generates Swift code based on templates.

Since Swift 5.9 (as of my last update) doesn't directly support macros, I'll guide you through creating a simple script that can generate the desired code. This script will be in Python, which you can run as a part of your build process or manually whenever you need to generate new code for different structs.

Here's a Python script that takes the name of a struct (e.g., `Setting`) as input and generates the Swift code you specified:

```python
import sys

def generate_swift_code(struct_name: str) -> None:
    wireframe_code = f"""
// MARK: Wireframe
import Foundation
import DomainLayer

// TODO: add {struct_name}Wireframe to AppRootRouter
public protocol {struct_name}Wireframe {{}}
"""

    presenter_dependency_code = f"""
// MARK: PresenterDependency
import Foundation
import DomainLayer

public protocol {struct_name}PresenterDependency {{}}
"""

    print(wireframe_code)
    print(presenter_dependency_code)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: script.py [StructName]")
    else:
        struct_name = sys.argv[1]
        generate_swift_code(struct_name)
```

To use this script:

1. Save it as `generate_swift_code.py` on your computer.
2. Run it from the command line, passing the name of your struct as an argument. For example, to generate code for a struct named `Setting`, you would run:

```
python3 generate_swift_code.py Setting
```

This script will print the generated Swift code to the console, which you can then copy into your Swift project.

For a more automated approach, especially if you're working on a larger project or team, consider integrating a code generation tool like Sourcery into your build process. Sourcery can read your Swift code, apply templates you define, and generate Swift code automatically. This approach requires setting up Sourcery templates that match the output you've provided, but it's highly scalable and integrates well with Swift projects.

Swift should be compatible with MACRO. I hope you've done your research.

Swift itself doesn't support macros in the same traditional sense as languages like C or C++. Instead, Swift offers other mechanisms for code generation, meta-programming, and automation, such as using preprocessor directives, build scripts, or external tools like Sourcery for more sophisticated code generation tasks. However, the example you're asking for resembles a task typically solved with code generation rather than macros.

Given the clarification and focusing strictly on Swift's capabilities and associated tooling, let's address how to achieve something similar within the Swift ecosystem, specifically for Swift 5.9 or later, considering Swift's evolution and tooling around it.

Swift doesn't have built-in macro support or a preprocessor for custom code generation at compile-time like the C preprocessor. Instead, code generation in Swift is usually handled by external tools or scripts that generate Swift files before compilation, which the Swift compiler then compiles as part of the build process.

**Approach with External Tooling (e.g., Sourcery):**

Sourcery is a popular tool in the Swift community for metaprogramming, allowing developers to generate Swift code automatically. It scans your source files, applies your templates, and generates Swift code for you. This is not a macro but achieves a similar result by generating code that you would include in your project.

**Sourcery Template Example:**

To generate code similar to what you've described using Sourcery, you would define a template (using Sourcery's template syntax) that takes your struct names as input and generates the protocol definitions for wireframes and presenter dependencies.

However, since creating a full Sourcery setup here is a bit complex and beyond the scope of a simple text response, I'll instead focus on how you might manually achieve a similar result without detailed steps on setting up Sourcery, assuming you're looking for a conceptual understanding or a simpler script-based approach.

**Swift Scripting for Code Generation:**

Another approach is Swift scripting itself. Swift can execute scripts, and you could write a Swift script that generates these files for you. This script would be a simple Swift program that takes a struct name as input and outputs the file contents you described.

However, as of my last update, directly embedding or running what you'd traditionally think of as a macro within Swift source files to generate other Swift code inline isn't supported natively by the language. Swift's focus on type safety, compile-time checks, and clarity tends to eschew the direct use of macros within source code, favoring external code generation and tooling solutions for these tasks.

For the exact implementation of a Swift script or setting up a tool like Sourcery, it would be best to look into their documentation and tailor the solution to your specific project setup, including how to integrate these tools into your build process using Xcode or another build system you're using.
