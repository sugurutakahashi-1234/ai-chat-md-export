As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, SwiftUI is a user interface toolkit introduced by Apple in 2019 that allows developers to design apps in a declarative way. It is available for all Apple platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

When you refer to "SwiftUIde", it appears you are combining "SwiftUI" with "IDE" (integrated development environment). As of my last training data, there's no specific IDE by that name. Instead, developers primarily use Xcode, Apple's official IDE, to create SwiftUI-based applications.

Xcode supports SwiftUI development by providing live previews of SwiftUI views, as well as interactive design tools for SwiftUI. It includes features such as a code editor, interface builder, debugging tools, and more. 

If there has been a development or a new tool called "SwiftUIde" introduced after my last update in September 2021, I wouldn't have the information. Please look up the most recent sources for this.
