The error messages indicate that Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) is having trouble accessing cached repositories due to the setting `'safe.bareRepository'` being set to `'explicit'`. This issue typically arises from Gitâ€™s configuration or SwiftPM's handling of repository caching.

Here's how you can resolve this:

### 1. **Clear SwiftPM Cache**
Try clearing the SwiftPM cache for the affected repositories:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm/repositories
```

This command removes the cached repositories, forcing SwiftPM to fetch fresh copies the next time you build or update packages.

### 2. **Check Git Configuration**
Ensure that Gitâ€™s configuration doesnâ€™t prevent access to these repositories:

- Open the global Git configuration file:
  ```bash
  git config --global --edit
  ```
- Look for any `safe.bareRepository` setting and remove or modify it.

### 3. **Update SwiftPM**
Ensure you are using the latest version of SwiftPM. If you have `mint` installed, try updating it:

```bash
mint install swift
```

### 4. **Check Permissions**
Confirm that you have proper permissions for the cache directory. Run the following command to ensure the correct permissions are set:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm
```

### 5. **Retry Package Fetching**
After performing the above steps, try fetching the packages again:

```bash
swift package update
```

These steps should help resolve the caching errors and allow SwiftPM to access the repositories correctly. Let me know if you encounter further issues!
