It looks like you have defined a Swift struct called `Foo`. It has five properties:

1. `int` of type `Int`, which is a required integer value.
2. `optionalInt` of type `Int?`, which is an optional integer value.
3. `array` of type `[Int]`, which is an array of integers.
4. `url` of type `URL`, which is a required URL value.
5. `optionalUrl` of type `URL?`, which is an optional URL value.

Note that the properties of the struct are declared using the `let` keyword, which means that they are immutable (cannot be changed once they are set).
