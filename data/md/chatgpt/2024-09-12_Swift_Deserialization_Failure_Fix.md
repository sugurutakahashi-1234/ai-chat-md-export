The error message you're encountering seems to be related to deserialization issues with the Swift Standard Library during compilation, specifically with the `Foundation` module's `NSDecimalString` function. This could be caused by a mismatch between the versions of Swift modules, likely due to a misconfiguration in Xcode or some SDK corruption. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### 1. **Clean Build Folder**
   Sometimes, outdated or corrupted build files can cause compilation issues.
   - In Xcode, go to the `Product` menu and select `Clean Build Folder` (or press `Shift + Command + K`).
   - Then, try rebuilding the project.

### 2. **Delete Derived Data**
   Derived Data can sometimes become corrupt, especially when switching between different versions of Xcode or Swift.
   - Go to `Xcode` &gt; `Preferences` &gt; `Locations`, and click the arrow next to the `Derived Data` path.
   - Delete the entire `Derived Data` folder for the affected project.

### 3. **Remove Swiftmodule Files in SDK**
   The error suggests that there might be an issue with the `swiftmodule` files in the SDK, particularly related to `Foundation`.
   - Navigate to the SDK path shown in the error (`/Applications/Xcode_16.1_beta_1.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift/iphonesimulator/prebuilt-modules/18.1/Foundation.swiftmodule/arm64-apple-ios-simulator.swiftmodule`).
   - Delete the `swiftmodule` files in that directory, but **keep the `.swiftinterface` files** as suggested by the error message.

### 4. **Ensure SDK and Xcode Consistency**
   - Make sure that the SDK you are using is consistent with your Xcode version. If you have multiple Xcode versions installed, ensure that the correct version is being used.
   - If possible, download and reinstall Xcode to ensure a clean and proper installation.

### 5. **Rebuild the Entire Project**
   After cleaning the build folder, deleting derived data, and removing swiftmodule files, try rebuilding the entire project from scratch.

### 6. **Use the Latest Beta (if Applicable)**
   - Since you are using Xcode 16.1 beta, this may be a bug with the beta version. Make sure you're using the latest beta version of Xcode 16.1 or consider reverting to a stable version.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the deserialization failure. Let me know if any of these help or if the issue persists!
