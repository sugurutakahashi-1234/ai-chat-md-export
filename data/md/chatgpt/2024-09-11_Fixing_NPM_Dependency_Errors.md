The error you're encountering seems to be due to an issue with one of the dependencies, specifically when trying to update `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli`. The npm command reports an issue with an undefined package version, which usually points to an incorrect or unavailable version reference.

Here are a few steps to try resolving the issue:

1. **Check your `package.json` for issues:**
   Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified and that there are no missing or undefined values. Specifically, ensure `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` has a correct version.

   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli": "^2.13.5",
     "asciidoctor": "^3.0.4",
     "asciidoctor-pdf": "^1.0.0-alpha.16"
   }
   ```

2. **Clear npm cache:**
   Sometimes npm caches outdated metadata. Run the following to clear your cache:
   
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. **Manually install the correct version:**
   If `npm audit fix --force` is causing issues, you can manually install the correct version of `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli`. Run:

   ```bash
   npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@2.13.5
   ```

4. **Try without `npm audit fix --force`:**
   Since `--force` can override important protections, try running the standard `npm audit fix` command to avoid unintended major version updates:

   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   ```

5. **Review the `npm` log file:**
   The error log is located at `/Users/sugurutakahashi/.npm/_logs/2024-09-11T07_45_32_205Z-debug-0.log`. Reviewing this file may provide more details about the missing version or other related issues.

If you try these steps and still face issues, feel free to share any additional error messages.

It seems like there are high-severity vulnerabilities that could be addressed by running `npm audit fix --force`, but it will result in breaking changes, particularly with the `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` package and `ws` through its dependencies.

### Here‚Äôs how you can address this situation:

1. **Update Individual Packages**: Instead of using `npm audit fix --force` which may introduce breaking changes, you can manually update specific packages that are vulnerable:
   
   - Update `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` manually to the latest stable version:
   
     ```bash
     npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@latest
     ```
   
   - If the issue persists with `asciidoctor-pdf` (due to its dependency on `puppeteer`), update `puppeteer` to a version that doesn't have the vulnerability:
   
     ```bash
     npm install puppeteer@latest
     ```

2. **Ignore Non-Critical Issues Temporarily**:
   If you don‚Äôt want to risk breaking changes, you can add exceptions for these vulnerabilities for now and continue using your current setup. This might be helpful if you're not directly affected by the vulnerable behavior:
   
   ```bash
   npm audit fix --omit=dev
   ```

   This will attempt to fix only the runtime dependencies and ignore the vulnerabilities in dev dependencies (such as `puppeteer`).

3. **Check Package Versions**:
   In your `npm audit report`, the message indicates `undefined@undefined` which means there is some misconfiguration in package versioning. Ensure your `package.json` is correctly defined, especially for dependencies.

   If necessary, manually specify a compatible version or look into the `@nestjs/core` dependency causing issues:

   ```bash
   npm install @nestjs/core@latest
   ```

4. **Manual Resolution**: Sometimes, certain package versions need to be manually adjusted. You can inspect `path-to-regexp` and try updating it directly:

   ```bash
   npm install path-to-regexp@latest
   ```

After these steps, you should either have the vulnerabilities resolved or the least disruptive updates made. Check again with `npm audit` to confirm.
