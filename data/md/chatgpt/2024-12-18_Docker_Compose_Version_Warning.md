The warning in your `docker-compose ps` output indicates that the `version` attribute in your `docker-compose.yml` file is obsolete and is no longer necessary in the latest Docker Compose versions. Docker Compose V2 has deprecated the use of the `version` attribute, and it will simply be ignored if present.

### Resolution

To avoid the warning:

1. **Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file**:
   - Open your `docker-compose.yml` file in a text editor.
   - Remove the `version` attribute (e.g., `version: '3.8'` or similar) from the file.

2. **Verify Compatibility**:
   - Ensure that your services and configurations are compatible with the latest Docker Compose. Most configurations from version 3.x are forward-compatible.

3. **Save the file** and re-run your Docker Compose commands. The warning should no longer appear.

### Example:
If your `docker-compose.yml` starts like this:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  guild_server:
    image: snpit_guild_server-guild_server
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"
  # Other services...
```

Update it to:
```yaml
services:
  guild_server:
    image: snpit_guild_server-guild_server
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"
  # Other services...
```

### Additional Notes:
- The rest of your `docker-compose ps` output looks fine.
- Your services (`guild_server`, `adminer`, `cache`, and `db`) are all running and mapped correctly to their respective ports.
