The naming convention for `MOCKOLO_custom-imports` suggests that it is likely a module or section in your project related to custom imports in a mocking framework. For the function or constant name `大文字あんなだースコア`, it can be translated to something like `UpperCaseAnnaScore`.

Given this, a suitable name for a function or constant could be:

```swift
let UpperCaseAnnaScore: Int = 0 // or the appropriate type and value
```

If you want to stick to the convention of using descriptive names and assuming it is a constant, it could be:

```swift
let mockUpperCaseAnnaScore: Int = 0 // Adjust type and value as needed
```

If you can provide more context or details on the specific use case or type, I can help refine the naming further.
