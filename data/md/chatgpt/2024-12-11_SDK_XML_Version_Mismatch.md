Warning: This version only understands SDK XML versions up to 3 but an SDK XML file of version 4 was encountered. This can happen if you use versions of Android Studio and the command-line tools that were released at different times.

The error indicates that the tools you're using (e.g., `sdkmanager` or `avdmanager`) are outdated and don't recognize the newer SDK XML version 4. This mismatch often occurs when you're using an older version of the Android command-line tools with a newer version of Android Studio or SDK.

Hereâ€™s how you can resolve this issue:

---

### 1. **Update Command-Line Tools**
Ensure that your command-line tools are up to date.

1. Open the SDK Manager:
   - In Android Studio: Go to **Tools > SDK Manager**.
   - Alternatively, locate it in your Android SDK directory.

2. Update the command-line tools:
   - Select **SDK Tools**.
   - Check the **Android SDK Command-line Tools** version and update it to the latest version.

3. Verify the installation:
   - Run `sdkmanager --version` to check the installed version.

---

### 2. **Use the Updated Command-Line Tools**
Ensure that the environment variables like `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` point to the updated SDK directory.

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$PATH
```

Replace `/path/to/your/android/sdk` with the actual path to your SDK installation.

---

### 3. **Ensure Consistency Between Android Studio and Command-Line Tools**
If the issue persists, it might be due to a mismatch between Android Studio's version and the SDK tools version. Update Android Studio to the latest stable version.

---

### 4. **Workaround for Specific Tools**
If updating isn't immediately possible:
- Open the XML file in question.
- Change the `version` attribute temporarily from `4` to `3`. Be cautious, as this could lead to unexpected behavior.

---

### 5. **Clean and Retry**
After updating the tools:
```bash
sdkmanager --update
```
Then, try your previous command again.

If the problem continues after these steps, let me know more details about your setup (e.g., tool version, Android Studio version, OS) for further assistance!
