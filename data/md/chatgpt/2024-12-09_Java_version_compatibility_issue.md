The error indicates that the Gradle build is encountering an issue due to an unsupported class file major version. This usually happens when the Java version used to compile the code is newer than the version supported by the Gradle version being used. In this case, class file major version 65 corresponds to **Java 21**.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Check the Java Version**:
   Run the following command to check your current Java version:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
   If it shows Java 21 or another version newer than Java 17, you need to adjust the Java version for compatibility with Gradle.

2. **Verify Gradle Compatibility**:
   Gradle version 7.6.3 does not support Java 21. Upgrade to a Gradle version that supports Java 21 (e.g., Gradle 8.3 or later).

   To update Gradle:
   - Use the Gradle Wrapper to upgrade:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.3
     ```

3. **Set the Correct Java Version**:
   If you need to use Gradle 7.6.3 for compatibility with your project or plugins, switch to Java 17 or Java 11.

   - Set the Java version globally:
     ```bash
     export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java17
     ```
   - Or configure it locally in your project by adding this to `gradle.properties`:
     ```properties
     org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/java17
     ```

4. **Rebuild the Project**:
   Once the correct Java version and Gradle version are configured, clean and rebuild your project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

### Verify the Fix:
Run the build again to ensure the issue is resolved. If the problem persists, double-check your Gradle version, Java version, and compatibility settings.
