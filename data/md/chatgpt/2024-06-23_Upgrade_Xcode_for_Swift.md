The error you're encountering is due to the `mintclipackage` requiring Swift tools version 6.0.0, while your installed version is 5.10.0. Additionally, there is an issue with the `xcrun` command, which is not able to find the platform path for macOS SDK.

To resolve these issues, follow these steps:

1. **Update Xcode Command Line Tools**:
   Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode Command Line Tools installed. You can update them with the following command:
   ```sh
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Ensure Correct SDK Path**:
   Set the correct SDK path by running:
   ```sh
   sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   ```

3. **Upgrade Swift Version**:
   If you need Swift tools version 6.0.0, you may need to install a version of Xcode that supports this version of Swift. Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode installed from the Mac App Store or [Apple's developer website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

4. **Reinstall Mint**:
   Ensure Mint is up to date and reinstalled if necessary:
   ```sh
   brew install mint
   brew upgrade mint
   ```

After ensuring these steps are followed, try running your command again:

```sh
swift run --package-path ./MintCLIPackage mint run mockolo -s ././SmallTalkPackage/Sources -d ././SmallTalkPackage/Sources/Presentation/Domain/Entity/Mocks.swift --custom-imports DomainLayer Combine -x Images Strings --mock-final
```

If the issues persist, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Check the specific Swift version required by your package and ensure compatibility with your environment.
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified in your `Package.swift` file.
- Verify that the paths provided in your command are correct and accessible.
