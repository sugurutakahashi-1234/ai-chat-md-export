Here are some GitHub repositories that introduce different aspects of architecture:

1. \[Awesome Software Architecture\](https://github.com/simskij/awesome-software-architecture) - A curated list of awesome articles and resources for learning and practicing software architecture, patterns, and principles.

2. \[Azure Enterprise-Scale\](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale) - Provides templates representing different scenarios composed using ARM templates for scalable architecture alongside business requirements.

3. \[Hexagonal Architecture in Java\](https://github.com/SvenWoltmann/hexagonal-architecture-java) - This repository demonstrates the hexagonal architecture with its separation into modules like model, application, adapters, and bootstrap.

These repositories should provide a good starting point for exploring different architectural concepts and practices.
