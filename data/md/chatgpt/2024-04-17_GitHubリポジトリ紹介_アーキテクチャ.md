Here are some GitHub repositories that introduce different aspects of architecture:

1. [Awesome Software Architecture](https://github.com/simskij/awesome-software-architecture) - A curated list of awesome articles and resources for learning and practicing software architecture, patterns, and principles.

2. [Azure Enterprise-Scale](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale) - Provides templates representing different scenarios composed using ARM templates for scalable architecture alongside business requirements.

3. [Hexagonal Architecture in Java](https://github.com/SvenWoltmann/hexagonal-architecture-java) - This repository demonstrates the hexagonal architecture with its separation into modules like model, application, adapters, and bootstrap.

These repositories should provide a good starting point for exploring different architectural concepts and practices.
