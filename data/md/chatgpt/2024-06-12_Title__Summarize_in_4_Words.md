{"transcription":"Hi, I\\u2019m Daisy.\\nAlong with my colleague, Jake,\\nwe\\u2019ll show you some\\nof what\\u2019s new in Xcode 16.\\nWe\\u2019re so excited, so let\\u2019s jump right in.\\nAt every phase of app\\ndevelopment, Xcode is there with you.\\nWe\\u2019ll look at what\\u2019s new\\nin Xcode 16 as you edit Swift code,\\nrun builds, debug amd test\\nyour code and maximize its performance.\\nLet's start with three things\\nthat are new when editing code.\\nFirst, code completion provides\\nmore thorough code suggestions\\nthanks to an on-device coding models\\nspecifically trained\\nfor Swift and Apple SDKs.\\nIt uses the surrounding code context\\nlike function names and comments\\nto move through your ideas faster.\\nThis is all made possible by Apple Silicon\\nand is available when\\nrunning Xcode 16 on macOS Sequoia.\\nNow let\\u2019s talk about Swift.\\nSwift 6 brings a new language mode that\\nprovides concurrency safety guarantees.\\nIt turns data races normally\\nonly experienced at runtime\\ninto compile-time issues.\\nThis is a great way to improve\\nthe correctness and safety of your code.\\nTo take advantage of these guarantees,\\nyou\\u2019ll want to adopt\\nthe Swift 6 language mode.\\nBut you can start today in Xcode 16\\nby incrementally enabling warnings\\nfor each upcoming language feature.\\nLet me show you how to do that.\\nI\\u2019m working on an app named BOTanist\\nwhere robots show\\noff their planting skills.\\nI want to prepare this app for Swift 6.\\nSo I\\u2019ll I start by navigating to\\nthe \\"Swift Compiler - Upcoming Features\\"\\nsection in the Build Settings.\\nHere, I can enable\\nupcoming compiler features one at a time.\\nI'll start by setting\\n\\"Isolated Global Variables\\u201d to Yes.\\nWhen I build, Xcode displays\\na new warning in the issues navigator.\\nLetting me know that logger, which is a\\nglobal variable, is not concurrency safe.\\nClicking on the issue,\\njumps right to where logger is defined.\\nI know logger doesn\\u2019t need to be mutated\\nso I can change it from var to let.\\nMaking it safe from any data races.\\nAdopting upcoming features\\nallows you to catch and address potential\\nissues before switching to Swift 6.\\nWhere these warnings\\nwill appear as errors.\\nAnd when ready, you can set the Swift\\nLanguage version in the build settings.\\nFor more on this, check out\\n\\u201cMigrate your app to Swift 6\\u201d.\\nXcode 16 also has some\\ngreat improvements for Previews.\\nPreviews allow you to quickly iterate\\non your UI to help you\\ncreate great user interfaces.\\nThere are two new APIs\\nthat make them simpler to write,\\nmore reusable, and better\\nintegrated with your model.\\nThe first is the Previewable macro.\\nPreviewable can be attached\\nto property wrappers like State,\\nallowing you to use them\\ndirectly within a preview block.\\nWriting wrapper views\\nis no longer necessary.\\nLet me show you an example in our app.\\nHere\\u2019s RobotFaceSelectorView.\\nIt takes a Binding to a RobotFace.\\nWhen I create a preview, I can define\\nmy state right in the preview's body\\nand attach the Previewable macro.\\nThis will tell the preview system\\nto create a wrapper view\\nbehind the scenes, so I don\\u2019t have to.\\nThen I can add my view.\\nWhich lets me see my\\nUI live with just a couple of lines!\\nThe second new API is PreviewModifier.\\nPreviewModifier makes it easier\\nto share environment or data for previews.\\nThis not only reduces duplicate code,\\nbut it also enables\\nthe preview system to cache the data.\\nI\\u2019ll switch to another view for this.\\nRobotNameSelectorView\\nrequires a RobotNamer to work.\\nThis type asynchronously retrieves\\npossible robot names from the server,\\nbut hitting the server over and over while\\nbuilding my previews, isn\\u2019t necessary.\\nI can use PreviewModifier\\nto create a RobotNamer for all my previews\\nwithout hitting our external server.\\nTo begin, I\\u2019ll define a type\\nthat conforms to PreviewModifier.\\nThis protocol has two requirements:\\nFirst, I use makeSharedContext\\nto load and store the data.\\nThis method is async and throwing,\\nso I can load data\\nasynchronously and handle errors.\\nIn this case, I create\\na RobotNamer with names from a local file\\nso I don\\u2019t hit our external server.\\nWhat\\u2019s key is that\\nthis method is only called once\\nfor all modifiers of the same type\\nas the preview system\\ncaches this data for me.\\nThe second requirement is the body method.\\nThe body method lets me wrap\\nthe preview with the shared context.\\nIn my conformance, I\\u2019ll pass RobotNamer\\nusing the environment modifier.\\nWith my modifier defined, I just need\\nto provide it to my preview using a trait.\\nBut, given I'm going\\nto use this modifier a lot,\\nI like to define\\nan extension on PreviewTrait\\nto reduce the code at each call site.\\nAll that\\u2019s left is to create my preview.\\nThis particular case is relatively simple.\\nBut PreviewModifier is especially helpful\\nwhen you need to share\\ndata between previews,\\nlike when using\\nSwiftData\\u2019s ModelContainer.\\nBeyond the API,\\nthis year is a huge leap forward\\nfor the performance\\nand underpinnings of previews.\\nEnabled by a new execution\\nengine, previews are faster than ever!\\nPowered by advances in the compiler,\\nthe build system, and operating systems,\\npreviews uses the same\\nbuild products for your project\\nand reassembles your program on the fly,\\nno longer needing\\nto produce a separate copy.\\nPreviews is one\\nimprovement with builds this year.\\nTo tell you about others,\\nI'll hand it over to Jake.\\nThanks, Daisy.\\nLet's rock and roll forward to builds.\\nXcode 16 supercharges\\nyour builds with Explicit Modules.\\nThis feature provides\\nimproved parallelism,\\nbetter diagnostics, and faster debugging,\\nall without changing\\na single line of code.\\nThat's unreal! How do you get it?\\nWell, for C and Objective-C,\\nexplicit modules are on by default.\\nFor Swift, you'll need to opt-in.\\nLet's give that a try.\\nI'll hop over to build settings,\\nenable Explicitly Built Modules,\\nand kick off a build.\\nHmm.\\nBy the way, with improvements\\nto Swift package integration in Xcode 16,\\nI was able to queue up that build\\nwithout having to wait\\nfor package resolution to finish first.\\nI like that!\\nSo what's actually happening now?\\nWith explicit modules, Xcode splits up\\nthe processing of each compilation unit\\ninto three separate phases:\\nscanning, building modules,\\nand finally, building the original code.\\nThe first two of these phases\\nare now surfaced in\\nthe build log as \\"Scan dependencies\\"\\nand \\"Compile Clang module\\"\\nor \\"Compile Swift module\\", commands.\\nPreviously, these operations\\nwere performed implicitly\\nas part of compiling your source files.\\nNow, you get a much more\\ndetailed breakdown of the build,\\nbetter parallelism,\\nand clearer error messages\\nif the build fails due to a module issue.\\nExplicit modules are also\\nreflected in the build timeline.\\nThis makes it easier to see where time\\nis being spent during the build process,\\nand helps you optimize your builds.\\nTo learn more, check out:\\n\\"Demystify explicitly built modules.\\"\\nAll right! Now that we've written and\\nbuilt some code, it's time to debug it.\\nBut first, let me tell you\\nabout a couple ways\\nthe build process feeds\\ninto debugging improvements:\\nExplicit modules make debugging faster,\\nsince lldb can re-use the build\\noutputs when evaluating expressions,\\nand DWARF5 is now\\nthe default debug symbol format\\nwhen building against a deployment\\ntarget of macOS Sequoia or iOS 18.\\nWith DWARF5, dSYM bundles are smaller,\\nand symbol lookups are faster.\\nWhen running in Xcode 16, the thread\\nperformance checker does even more.\\nIn addition to finding main thread\\nhangs and priority inversions,\\nit will now show excessive disk write\\nand slow app launch diagnostics\\nto help you improve\\nyour app's performance.\\nIn the Organizer,\\nthis comes with a new category\\nof diagnostic logs for app launches.\\nIf your app takes a long time\\nto launch on customer devices,\\nXcode will show you\\nthe slowest code path signatures,\\nso you can prioritize\\nfixing issues with the largest impact.\\nAnd, if you're familiar\\nwith disk write diagnostics,\\nyou'll love this trendy new update.\\nNow in the organizer, you can see\\nhow the impact of issues has changed\\nacross different versions of your app.\\nWhen you go to the disk writes view\\nyou can see that there are up arrows\\nnext to some of the signatures.\\nThese arrows are a great place to start,\\nhelping you prioritize issues\\nwith the greatest impact to your users.\\nWhile debugging your code,\\nthe Thread Performance\\nChecker will surface the worst of these\\nas runtime issues,\\npinpointing the exact\\nline of code to focus on,\\neven if the issue isn't\\nreproducing for you locally.\\nIn this example it looks\\nlike the Thread Performance Checker\\nflagged an issue\\nthat's impacting our customers.\\nIt says we shouldn't be loading\\nthis video asset on the main thread.\\nI'm going to open up Xcode and set\\na breakpoint so I can track this down.\\nI'll go ahead and open\\nthe file with the issue\\nand click in the gutter\\nto set a breakpoint, and run.\\nOK, it hit the breakpoint.\\nTo make it easier to trace\\nwhere this call is coming from,\\nI'm going to enable the\\nUnified Backtrace View from the Debug Bar.\\nThis new visualization allows me to\\nfollow the call stack\\nand view the surrounding code\\nin each frame simply by scrolling down.\\nI can even hover over variables to see their values.\\nOh, here in the View body method\\nthere's an \\"await\\" calling into that code.\\nWe've traced the call.\\nIt's coming from inside the app!\\nIt looks like this video player\\ninitialization function is asynchronous\\nand, it's being invoked\\nfrom a SwiftUI task modifier\\nbut it's inheriting the @MainActor\\ncontext from the enclosing SwiftUI view\\nand doing I/O on the main thread!\\nI think I'll fix this issue\\nby marking it nonisolated.\\nThat ought to do it.\\nThanks to the Unified Backtrace View,\\nalong with the Thread Performance Checker\\nand new Organizer reporting,\\nXcode helps you focus\\non what matters most.\\nSpatial development\\ngets a whole lot easier too,\\nwith the new RealityKit debugger.\\nNow with the click of a button,\\nyou can capture a snapshot\\nof your running app's entity hierarchy,\\nand explore it in 3D,\\nright inside of Xcode.\\nThis debugger lets you view\\nentities and their components,\\nand inspect both built-in\\nand custom properties.\\nTo learn more about\\nthe RealityKit debugger,\\nor the existing debuggers, check out:\\n\\"Break into the RealityKit debugger\\",\\nand \\"Run, break, and inspect:\\nExplore effective debugging in LLDB.\\"\\nNow, back to Daisy to test things out!\\nAwesome debugging Jake!\\nJust like debugging helps you\\nsolve problems while\\nin the middle of development,\\ntesting is a great way to catch issues\\nand regressions in future iterations.\\nSwift Testing is a new framework\\nthat leverages Swift language features\\nto make expressing tests\\nmore powerful and concise.\\nAnd these tests work right\\nalongside your existing XCTests.\\nLet me show you\\nan example of Swift Testing.\\nThe team and I are adding\\na new feature to BOTanist.\\nRobots are getting new\\nplanting styles and animation states!\\nBut I haven\\u2019t tested them all.\\nSo let\\u2019s add new tests.\\nTo start, I\\u2019ll create a new file\\nin the test folder and name it PlantTests.\\nTo create a test, first I\\u2019ll import\\nthe Testing framework and our app,\\nthen write a function\\ncalled plantingRoses.\\nI can name this function whatever I want\\nand to benefit\\nfrom everything Swift Testing provides,\\nall I need to do is add the Test macro.\\nAs soon as I added the test macro,\\nXcode knows this is a test\\nand displays it in the navigator.\\nIn this test,\\nI want to verify that a roses\\u2019s\\ndefault planting style is grafting.\\nThe first thing I will do\\nis create a Plant of type rose.\\nNext, I\\u2019ll create\\na second Plant of type rose\\nbut give it grafting\\nas its explicit style.\\nNice, that\\u2019s exactly what I want!\\nAnd finally, I\\u2019ll verify they are\\nequal using the expect macro.\\nThis macro takes any boolean expression.\\nI can use it to verify\\nstrings, floats, or other types.\\nAnd now let\\u2019s run the test.\\nOh-oh. Unfortunately the test failed.\\nThe test is saying that\\nthe two roses are not the same.\\nBut based on the error description,\\nthey sure look the same\\nBoth display the same emoji!\\nHowever, I don\\u2019t know\\nwhat the other properties look like.\\nWith Swift Testing,\\nI can view additional information\\nabout each value\\nby clicking \\"Show Details\\" in the error\\nso I can inspect more closely.\\nAhh, the planting styles are different.\\nGood thing I wrote a test to check\\nthe default value! This is a quick fix.\\n.Seedling should be .graft.\\nLet\\u2019s run the test again to verify that it\\npasses. I can do so using quick actions.\\nTo bring up quick actions\\nI use the shortcut command shift A.\\nThen I\\u2019ll type \\u201ctest again\\u201d\\nto rerun this specific test.\\nSuper, it passed!\\nThe test macro not only\\nmarks functions as tests.\\nIt also accepts a variety of traits\\nthat can add information\\nor change their behavior.\\nFor example, you can provide a display\\nname or arguments to a test function.\\nThis test checks\\nmy robot AnimationState machine.\\nI want to make sure these\\nstates can transition to celebrate.\\nInstead of writing\\nmultiple test functions,\\nwe provide the test\\nmacro the list of states.\\nAnd have a single test function\\nthat takes a state as its parameter.\\nNow, let\\u2019s run this parameterized test.\\nIn Swift Testing each provided argument\\nruns in parallel as its own test case.\\nThe navigator displays\\neach case individually,\\nletting me know which variations failed.\\nAnd it looks like\\nthe plant animation state did.\\nI probably forgot to include .celebrate as\\na valid state transition. Let\\u2019s fix that.\\nNow, I can rerun just the failing test\\ncase by clicking on the button next to it.\\nExcellent! All test cases pass!\\nAnother benefit of Swift Testing\\nin Xcode is tag-based organization.\\nSwift Testing lets me create tags\\nto group tests across different suites.\\nI\\u2019d really like to do\\nthat with this feature\\nso I know which tests relate to it.\\nTo start, I\\u2019ll extend the Tag\\ntype to include my custom tag, planting.\\nThen I\\u2019ll add the tag to the Test\\nmacro of the tests I want to label.\\nI'll add it to this test.\\nAnd also to plantingRoses.\\nWith the tags applied, the navigator's\\ntag view shows them grouped together.\\nIf I want to run all tests in the tag,\\nI can click the button next to it.\\nTags can also be used to include\\nor exclude tests from test plans.\\nI\\u2019ll go to the test plan\\nby choosing \\"Edit Test Plan\\"\\nat the top of the navigator.\\nThe new planting and animation\\nfeature is still under development.\\nAnd I don\\u2019t want to cause any instability\\nin our CI because of these tests.\\nSo instead, I'll add the tag\\nfor this feature to the excluded tags list\\nuntil I'm ready to enable it.\\nTo learn more about Swift Testing,\\ncheck out \\u201cMeet Swift Testing\\u201d\\nand \\u201cGo further with Swift Testing\\u201d.\\nWe've debugged and tested our code.\\nThe tests run fast, but the\\napp doesn\\u2019t. I\\u2019ll let Jake take a look.\\nThanks, Daisy.\\nSo we just got done verifying the\\nfunctionality of our app using testing.\\nBut when I run it,\\nI\\u2019ve noticed the launch takes a lot\\nmore time than I initially expected.\\nThe best tool to diagnose\\nyour performance problems is Instruments,\\nwhich you can access\\nfrom the Profile action right from Xcode.\\nI have a trace of our app's launch\\nthat Daisy recorded\\nusing the \\u201cTime Profiler\\u201d Instrument.\\nThis Instrument visualizes\\nCPU usage in our code\\nand allows us to measure\\nhow long it's taking to run.\\nLet's take a look at that now.\\nWhoa! That's a lot of CPU usage.\\nAnd a really long hang during the initial\\nlaunch. Let\\u2019s see what we can do about it.\\nTo understand why it\\u2019s happening,\\nI'll start by setting the\\ninspection range to the hang interval.\\nNow that I\\u2019m only looking at a portion\\nof the trace, let\\u2019s analyze the data.\\nTo help narrow down the problem,\\nI'll use Instruments 16's new Flame Graph,\\nwhich I can activate from the jump bar.\\nFlame Graph is an excellent high\\nlevel overview of the trace execution,\\nwhich allows us\\nto spot issues at a glance.\\nExecution intervals are weighted by the\\npercentage of time they took in the trace\\nand the intervals\\nare sorted left to right.\\nThis means that the left part of the graph\\nwill always visualize code\\nthat executed the most.\\nLet\\u2019s take a look\\nat what my program is executing.\\nIt looks like this load function\\nis nearly all of the execution time.\\nAnd it's being called\\nfrom a SwiftUI View body.\\nThat doesn't seem right.\\nI'll right click on this\\nframe and select \\u201cReveal in Xcode\\u201d,\\nwhich will take me right to the code.\\nAh, I think I see the problem.\\nWe're loading a bunch\\nof assets serially in a loop,\\nand we're doing it on the main thread.\\nNot too good.\\nTo fix this, I'll parallelize\\nthe loading using a task group,\\nwhich will also move execution of this\\nwork to the background where it belongs.\\nAnd now I'll rebuild,\\nand take a new Time Profile\\nin Instruments, to see if that helped.\\nFlame graphs work for every\\nInstrument that uses call-trees.\\nThis visual way of seeing your callstacks\\nis a great way of finding issues,\\nand another reason\\nto profile your app regularly.\\nNice! The launch was blazing fast.\\nI can see in the flame graph\\nthat the asset loading is now distributed\\nacross multiple background threads,\\nand no longer blocking the main thread.\\nThose are just some of the new\\nand exciting features of Xcode 16.\\nTo learn more about what you saw\\nor improvements like Faster UI previews,\\nthe Hardened C++ runtime,\\nimproved localization workflows, and more,\\ncheck out our release\\nnotes on developer.apple.com.\\nOr better yet: download\\nXcode 16 and give it a try!\\nThanks for watching,\\nand have a great WWDC!"}
