ブックマークアイコンを追加してほしい。ブックマーク情報はgetSpotDetailのSpotDetailDTOにisFavoriteという変数名で入っている。

I'll add a bookmark icon to the spot detail page. Let me implement that for you.

I've added bookmark functionality to the SpotDetailPage with the following key changes:

1. Added a bookmark icon to the AppBar actions
   - Shows a filled bookmark icon when `isFavorite` is true
   - Shows an outline bookmark icon when `isFavorite` is false
   - The bookmark icon is colored differently when active

2. Added a larger bookmark button overlay on the image
   - Positioned in the bottom-right corner of the image
   - Has a semi-transparent background for better visibility
   - Uses the same icon states based on the favorite status

3. Fixed the `onTapBookmark` function to toggle the current favorite status
   - Previously it was only setting to `true`
   - Now it properly toggles between states with `!currentFavoriteStatus`

4. Made the function no longer ignored with the removal of the `// ignore: unused_element` comment

The bookmark functionality works by reading the `isFavorite` property from the SpotDetailDTO and using the `updateFavoriteStatus` method from the `updateSpotDetailNotifierProvider` to toggle the status.
