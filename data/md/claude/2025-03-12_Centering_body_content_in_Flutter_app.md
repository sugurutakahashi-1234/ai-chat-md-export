I see you're having an issue with centering the body content in your Flutter app. Looking at your code and the screenshot, I can identify what's happening with the `Center` widget in your `ExplorerListPage`.

The problem is that while you're using a `Center` widget to wrap your main `Column`, the `Column` itself is expanding to take up all available space with its children. Let me explain why this is happening and how to fix it:

1. Your main content is wrapped in:
```dart
return Center(
  child: Column(
    children: [
      // widgets...
    ],
  ),
);
```

2. But by default, a `Column` tries to be as big as its parent allows in the cross axis (horizontal direction in this case), which means it's already expanding to fill the width even without the `Center` widget.

Here's how you can fix it:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn‚Äôt yet supported on mobile.
```



The issue is that even though you're using a `Center` widget, the `Column` inside it is expanding to take the full width of the screen. Here's what's happening:

1. `Center` positions its child in the middle of available space
2. But the `Column` is set by default to expand to fill its parent's width
3. This makes the `Center` seem like it's not working, because the `Column` is already taking the full width

To fix this, you have a few options:

## Option 1: Use Column's Alignment Properties

```dart
return Column(
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    // Your widgets...
  ],
);
```

This centers all children horizontally within the column.

## Option 2: Constrain Children's Width

For widgets that need specific width control (like your "Target" section):

```dart
return Column(
  children: [
    // Carousel...
    
    const SizedBox(height: 24),
    // Constrain the width of the search type section
    Container(
      width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.9, // 90% of screen width
      child: searchTypeAsyncValue.when(
        // Your existing code...
      ),
    ),
  ],
);
```

## Option 3: Use Alignment for Specific Widgets

If you need more granular control, you can align individual widgets:

```dart
Align(
  alignment: Alignment.center,
  child: YourWidget(),
)
```

The key issue in your case is that the `Padding` widget around your search type section is taking the full width available, so even though you're using `Center`, it's not visually centering because the content already spans the full width.

Would you like me to provide a complete revised version of your page with the centering fixed?
