# Code Quality Reports

This directory contains automated code quality analysis reports.

## Available Reports

| File | Purpose | Generated By |
|------|---------|--------------|
| [`unused-code.md`](./unused-code.md) | Lists unused exports, dependencies, and files | [Knip](https://github.com/webpro/knip) |

**Note**: An empty `unused-code.md` file means there is no unused code - this is the ideal state! No content = healthy codebase.

## How to Generate

```bash
# Automatically generated in CI and pre-commit
bun run update:docs:all

# Generate only this report
bun run update:docs:knip
```
