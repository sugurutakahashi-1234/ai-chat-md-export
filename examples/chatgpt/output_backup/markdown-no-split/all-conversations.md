How do I reverse a string in Python?

---

There are several ways to reverse a string in Python:

1. **Using slicing (most common):**
```python
text = "hello"
reversed_text = text[::-1]
print(reversed_text)  # Output: "olleh"
```

2. **Using reversed() function:**
```python
text = "hello"
reversed_text = ''.join(reversed(text))
print(reversed_text)  # Output: "olleh"
```

3. **Using a loop:**
```python
text = "hello"
reversed_text = ''
for char in text:
    reversed_text = char + reversed_text
print(reversed_text)  # Output: "olleh"
```

The slicing method `[::-1]` is the most Pythonic and efficient approach.

Thanks! The slicing method looks very clean.

Exactly! The slicing notation `[::-1]` is very concise. The syntax means:
- Start at the end of the string
- End at position 0
- Step backwards by -1

It's one of Python's elegant features that makes string manipulation simple and readable.
