Absolutely! Here are my best tips for a fluffy omelet:

1. **Room temperature eggs**: Take them out 10 minutes before cooking

2. **Add liquid**: 1 tablespoon of milk or water per 2 eggs

3. **Whisk thoroughly**: Beat until you see bubbles - this incorporates air

4. **Medium-low heat**: Too high heat makes eggs tough

5. **Butter the pan well**: Use about 1 tablespoon for richness

6. **Don't overstir**: Once eggs are in the pan, gently push cooked edges toward center

7. **Remove from heat early**: The omelet continues cooking from residual heat

**Pro tip**: Some chefs add a tiny pinch of baking powder for extra fluffiness!

The key is gentle heat and not overworking the eggs. Good luck with your omelet!
