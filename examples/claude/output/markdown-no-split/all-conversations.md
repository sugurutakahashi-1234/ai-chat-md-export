I don't have access to real-time weather data or location information, so I can't tell you the current weather conditions. However, I'd be happy to help you find weather information if you tell me which location you're interested in! You could check weather websites like weather.com or weather apps for current conditions.

Here are some reliable ways to check weather forecasts:

1. **Weather Apps**: Apps like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or your phone's built-in weather app provide detailed forecasts

2. **National Weather Service**: For US locations, weather.gov offers official government forecasts

3. **Google Search**: Simply searching "weather [your city]" gives you a quick forecast

4. **Local News**: TV and radio stations often have dedicated meteorologists for your area

5. **Extended Forecasts**: For planning ahead, look for 7-10 day forecasts, but remember they become less accurate beyond 3-5 days

Pro tip: Check multiple sources for important weather-dependent plans!

The omelet sounds perfect! Any tips for making it fluffy?

Absolutely! Here are my best tips for a fluffy omelet:

1. **Room temperature eggs**: Take them out 10 minutes before cooking

2. **Add liquid**: 1 tablespoon of milk or water per 2 eggs

3. **Whisk thoroughly**: Beat until you see bubbles - this incorporates air

4. **Medium-low heat**: Too high heat makes eggs tough

5. **Butter the pan well**: Use about 1 tablespoon for richness

6. **Don't overstir**: Once eggs are in the pan, gently push cooked edges toward center

7. **Remove from heat early**: The omelet continues cooking from residual heat

**Pro tip**: Some chefs add a tiny pinch of baking powder for extra fluffiness!

The key is gentle heat and not overworking the eggs. Good luck with your omelet!
