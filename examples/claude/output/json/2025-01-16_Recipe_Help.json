      "content": "Absolutely! Here are my best tips for a fluffy omelet:\n\n1. **Room temperature eggs**: Take them out 10 minutes before cooking\n\n2. **Add liquid**: 1 tablespoon of milk or water per 2 eggs\n\n3. **Whisk thoroughly**: Beat until you see bubbles - this incorporates air\n\n4. **Medium-low heat**: Too high heat makes eggs tough\n\n5. **Butter the pan well**: Use about 1 tablespoon for richness\n\n6. **Don't overstir**: Once eggs are in the pan, gently push cooked edges toward center\n\n7. **Remove from heat early**: The omelet continues cooking from residual heat\n\n**Pro tip**: Some chefs add a tiny pinch of baking powder for extra fluffiness!\n\nThe key is gentle heat and not overworking the eggs. Good luck with your omelet!",
